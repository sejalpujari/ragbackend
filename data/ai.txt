Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to computer systems designed to perform tasks that normally require human intelligence, such as reasoning, learning, problem-solving, perception, and understanding language. AI systems can be rule-based or data-driven, with modern AI largely relying on machine learning and deep learning techniques to identify patterns from large datasets. AI is widely used in real-world applications such as recommendation systems, virtual assistants, fraud detection, medical diagnosis, autonomous vehicles, and robotics, helping automate tasks and improve decision-making efficiency
